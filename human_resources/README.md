# 1. Business Problem

Kalf's company wants to avoid hiring costs and the reasons will be mentioned below. I, as a data scientist, along with this department, aim to predict which employees are likely to leave the company.

This forecast is important for the following reasons:
- Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills;
- "Companies spend 15% to 20% of employee salary to recruit a new candidate";
- "The average company loses between 1% and 2.5% of its total revenue in the time it takes to train a new employee";
- It costs an average of $7645 to hire a new employee (in a company with approximately 500 employees); 
- There is still the money you need to invest in onboarding and training new employees. It takes about 52 days for an employee to actually occupy their new position;
